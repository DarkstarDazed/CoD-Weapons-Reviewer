# CoD-Weapons-Reviewer

## Description

The application built was developed for users who like to play Call of Duty.  With our app, we allow the user to login or sign-up to their account and review a series of weapons broken down into different categories.  The categories are Submachine Guns, Assault Rifles and Sniper Rifles.  Within each category, the user is able to select from four different weapon choices, view other user reviews and ultimately leave a review.

## User Story

As a user, I want to be able to log in or create an account.
Then, I would like to be brought to a new page where I can select the type of gun I want to review. 
Once I make a selection, I want to see a list of various guns from the selected category, see reviews and also leave a review.
